# A baseline solution for plants classification problem
The dataset used for this solution is heavily imbalanced, upsampling and augmentation techniques were used to handle that.
As the main metric macro f1 was used to ensure that all classes are "seen" by the model equally well.
The model achieves 80% macro f1.
